## üîç CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GAPS IDENTIFIED (September 2025)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation vs Implementation Misalignment DISCOVERED
**Post-cleanup analysis revealed remaining credibility issues**:
- **Internal README Contradictions**: Claims "Parquet logging" while listing as missing
- **SPECIFICATION Overpromising**: Documents "myopic A*" and "budget-side cost deductions" that don't exist
- **Impact**: Undermines recent documentation cleanup achievements

### üö® Core Phase 2 Functionality Missing
**Key spatial friction mechanisms are documented but non-functional**:
- **Travel Cost Integration**: `_generate_agent_orders` ignores travel-adjusted budgets w_i = max(0, p¬∑œâ_total - Œ∫¬∑d_i)
- **Movement Implementation**: Only single greedy step, not documented "myopic A*" pathfinding  
- **TODO at line 141**: scripts/run_simulation.py records distance but never deducts Œ∫¬∑d from wealth
- **Result**: Spatial costs have no effect on agent behavior despite being core design feature

### üîß Technical Debt Issues
- **Dual Position Classes**: Incompatible types in src/core/types.py and src/spatial/grid.py
- **Test Prerequisites**: pip install -e . requirement not sufficiently emphasized

## üõ†Ô∏è CONCRETE IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES

### **IMMEDIATE: Credibility Restoration (30 minutes)**
1. **Fix README contradictions**: Remove false "Parquet logging" claims from features
2. **Update SPECIFICATION.md**: Add implementation status notes ("planned" vs "implemented")
3. **Align movement docs**: Change "myopic A*" to match actual single-step greedy behavior
4. **Clarify prerequisites**: Emphasize pip install -e . requirement for tests

### **HIGH PRIORITY: Core Functionality (1-2 hours)**  
5. **Implement travel costs**: Add budget deduction in scripts/run_simulation.py:141
6. **Fix order generation**: Update _generate_agent_orders to use travel-adjusted wealth
7. **Unify Position types**: Choose src/spatial/grid.py as canonical Position class

### **RESEARCH DECISION: Movement Policy (Variable time)**
8. **Option A - Full A* Implementation**: 2-3 hours, enables sophisticated spatial research
9. **Option B - Honest Documentation**: 15 minutes, align docs with simple greedy movement

### **Specific Code Changes Required**:
```python
# Priority 1: scripts/run_simulation.py (line 141 TODO)
distance_moved = agent.move_one_step_toward_marketplace()
# ADD: agent.wealth -= movement_cost * distance_moved

# Priority 2: src/econ/market.py _generate_agent_orders  
# CHANGE: Use w_i = max(0, p¬∑œâ_total - Œ∫¬∑d_i) instead of personal inventory only

# Priority 3: Position unification
# REMOVE: src/core/types.py Position class
# USE: src/spatial/grid.py Position everywhere
```
## Implementation Patterns & Standards (When Environment Works)

### File Organization
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.py          # Numerical tolerances and system constants
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent.py          # Agent class with Cobb-Douglas utilities

```

**Note**: Many references to simulation.py, welfare.py, movement.py, and config/loader.py in documentation refer to planned components not yet implemented. Current simulation logic is embedded in test scenarios and run scripts.

### Development Workflow & Commands (Fully Functional)

```bash
# These commands work perfectly with setup.py and pytest.ini:
make install-dev       # ‚úÖ WORKS: Complete package configuration
make test             # ‚úÖ WORKS: 84/84 tests passing
make format           # ‚úÖ WORKS: Code formatting and quality checks
make run CONFIG=config/edgeworth.yaml SEED=42  # ‚úÖ WORKS: Full simulation execution

# All test commands are functional:
pytest tests/unit/ -v          # ‚úÖ WORKS: 74/74 unit tests passing
pytest tests/validation/ -v    # ‚úÖ WORKS: 10/10 validation scenarios passing
```

### Key Configuration Constants (From SPECIFICATION.md)
```python
# Numerical tolerances - USE THESE EXACT VALUES
SOLVER_TOL = 1e-8        # Primary convergence: ||Z_rest||_‚àû < SOLVER_TOL  
FEASIBILITY_TOL = 1e-10  # Conservation and feasibility checks
RATIONING_EPS = 1e-10    # Prevent division by zero in rationing

# Economic parameters
NUMERAIRE_GOOD = 0       # Good 1 is num√©raire (p[0] ‚â° 1.0)
MIN_ALPHA = 0.05         # Minimum preference weight (ensures interior solutions)
```

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Code Quality Standards
- **Type hints**: All functions must have proper type annotations
- **Docstrings**: Include mathematical formulas and economic interpretation
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages
- **Performance**: Vectorized numpy operations for 100+ agents

#### Economic Correctness Checks
```python
# Every function that modifies economic state should validate invariants
def transfer_goods(agent: Agent, goods: np.ndarray, to_personal: bool = True):
    """Transfer goods between home and personal inventory"""
    initial_total = agent.home_endowment + agent.personal_endowment
    
    if to_personal:
        agent.home_endowment -= goods
        agent.personal_endowment += goods
    else:
        agent.personal_endowment -= goods
        agent.home_endowment += goods
    
    # Invariant: total endowment conserved
    final_total = agent.home_endowment + agent.personal_endowment
    assert np.allclose(initial_total, final_total, atol=FEASIBILITY_TOL)
    
    # Invariant: non-negativity
    assert np.all(agent.home_endowment >= -FEASIBILITY_TOL)
    assert np.all(agent.personal_endowment >= -FEASIBILITY_TOL)
```

## Validation Scenarios (Implementation Targets)

### Priority Scenarios for Phase 1
**V1: Edgeworth Box Verification**
```python
def test_edgeworth_2x2_analytical():
    """Verify against known analytical solution for 2 agents, 2 goods"""
    # Agent 1: Œ±‚ÇÅ = [0.6, 0.4], œâ‚ÇÅ = [1, 0]  
    # Agent 2: Œ±‚ÇÇ = [0.3, 0.7], œâ‚ÇÇ = [0, 1]
    # Analytical equilibrium: p* = [1, 6/7], x‚ÇÅ* = [6/7, 2/7], x‚ÇÇ* = [1/7, 5/7]
    
    agents = create_edgeworth_agents()
    prices, z_norm = solve_walrasian_equilibrium(agents)
    
    expected_prices = np.array([1.0, 6/7])
    assert np.allclose(prices, expected_prices, atol=1e-8)
    assert z_norm < SOLVER_TOL
```

**V2: Spatial Null Test**
```python
def test_spatial_null_efficiency():
    """With Œ∫=0 and all agents at marketplace, Phase 2 should equal Phase 1"""
    # This tests that spatial extensions don't break baseline economics
    phase1_result = run_phase1_simulation(agents, n_rounds=1)
    phase2_result = run_phase2_simulation(agents, movement_cost=0.0, n_rounds=1)
    
    assert np.allclose(phase1_result.allocation, phase2_result.allocation)
    assert abs(phase1_result.welfare - phase2_result.welfare) < FEASIBILITY_TOL
```

### Common Implementation Pitfalls ‚ö†Ô∏è
```python
# WRONG: Using length of prices array to infer n_goods
n_goods = len(prices)  # ‚ùå Breaks with normalization

# CORRECT: Use agent data structure
n_goods = agents[0].alpha.size  # ‚úÖ Always reliable

# WRONG: Using Walras' Law for primary convergence test
converged = abs(np.dot(prices, excess_demand)) < tolerance  # ‚ùå Can be misleading

# CORRECT: Use rest-goods norm as primary test
z_rest_norm = np.linalg.norm(excess_demand[1:], ord=np.inf)
converged = z_rest_norm < SOLVER_TOL  # ‚úÖ Proper convergence test

# WRONG: Forgetting num√©raire constraint
prices = scipy.optimize.fsolve(excess_demand, initial_guess)  # ‚ùå No normalization

# CORRECT: Solve for rest goods with num√©raire constraint
def excess_demand_rest(p_rest):
    prices = np.concatenate([[1.0], p_rest])  # p‚ÇÅ ‚â° 1
    return excess_demand(prices)[1:]  # Return rest goods only

p_rest = scipy.optimize.fsolve(excess_demand_rest, initial_guess[1:])
prices = np.concatenate([[1.0], p_rest])  # ‚úÖ Proper normalization
```

## Phase 2+ Future Extensions (Deferred)

### Spatial Extensions (Phase 2)
- **Grid-based movement**: A* pathfinding with Manhattan distance
- **Marketplace access**: Only agents in central marketplace can trade
- **Movement costs**: Œ∫¬∑distance budget deduction in num√©raire units
- **Local-participants equilibrium**: Prices computed from marketplace agents only

### Local Price Formation (Phase 3)  
- **Bilateral bargaining**: Nash bargaining for co-located agents
- **Dynamic pricing**: Prices emerge from local trading, not global computation
- **Spatial arbitrage**: Price differences drive agent movement decisions

### Advanced Features (Phase 4+)
- **Production**: Firms, technology, factor markets
- **Money & credit**: Monetary economics, banking systems
- **Behavioral economics**: Learning, bounded rationality, social preferences

## AI Assistant Guidelines ü§ñ

### When Working on This Project
1. **Always prioritize economic correctness** over coding convenience
2. **Validate invariants** in every function that modifies economic state
3. **Use proper mathematical notation** from SPECIFICATION.md (Z_market, not Z)
4. **Test against known analytical solutions** (Edgeworth box, simple cases)
5. **Follow .gitignore rules** - exclude venv/, __pycache__/, *.pyc, etc.
6. **Focus on research applications** - platform is ready for serious economic work

### Critical Implementation Gaps (September 2025 Analysis)
**BEFORE implementing new features, be aware of these known issues**:

1. **Documentation Alignment**: Check for internal contradictions (e.g., claiming features that are listed as missing)
2. **Travel Cost Gap**: Core spatial mechanism documented but non-functional - agents not charged for movement
3. **Movement Policy Mismatch**: Spec promises "myopic A*" but code implements single greedy step
4. **Position Type Drift**: Two incompatible Position classes risk integration bugs
5. **Test Prerequisites**: Emphasize pip install -e . requirement for pytest functionality

### When Implementing Spatial Features
**Priority Order for Phase 2 Completion**:
1. **Travel cost integration first** - core spatial friction mechanism
2. **Position unification** - architectural cleanup 
3. **Movement policy decision** - A* implementation vs documentation alignment
4. **Documentation sync** - ensure promises match implementation

### Decision Framework for Future Work
**When user requests spatial improvements, present these options**:
- **Option A: Implement missing features** (travel costs, A*) for full spatial research capability
- **Option B: Align documentation** with current greedy movement for honest representation  
- **Option C: Research applications** using excellent Phase 1 engine while spatial gaps exist

### Current Implementation Context
