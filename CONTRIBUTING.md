## Contribution Guidelines

### Current Blockers

**BEFORE attempting any development**:
1. **Use Working Setup**: Follow the verified setup instructions above
2. **Install Package**: Run `pip install -e .` after creating virtual environment  
3. **Verify Tests**: Run `make test` to confirm 197/197 tests pass
4. **Start Development**: Complete economic platform ready for contributions

### Code Standards (When Environment Works)

1. **Economic Correctness**: All code must preserve economic invariants
   - Walras' Law: p·Z_market(p) ≡ 0
   - Conservation: Total goods conserved across all operations
   - Budget constraints: p·x ≤ p·ω for all agents
   - Value feasibility: buy_value ≤ sell_value per round per agent

2. **Code Quality**
   - Use type hints throughout
   - Follow PEP 8 style (enforced by black/ruff)
   - Write docstrings for all public functions
   - Add unit tests for new functionality

3. **Performance**
   - Use vectorized numpy operations where possible
   - Target 100+ agents with <30 seconds per 1000 rounds
   - Profile performance-critical sections

4. **Reproducibility**
   - All experiments must be configurable via YAML
   - Use fixed random seeds: `np.random.seed(seed)` and `random.seed(seed)`
   - Set deterministic environment: `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS=1`

### Economic Testing (Comprehensive Validation Framework)

#### Test Status Verified ✅
The project provides complete test coverage with verified functionality:
- **Import system working**: All modules properly importable after package installation
- **197/197 tests passing**: Complete validation including unit tests and economic scenarios
- **Production-ready**: Full economic simulation platform ready for research

#### Working Test Commands
```bash
# These commands work with proper setup:
pip install -e .        # Install package in development mode ✅
make test               # Run full test suite (197/197 passing) ✅
pytest tests/unit/ -v   # Run unit tests (74/74 passing) ✅
pytest tests/validation/ -v # Run validation scenarios (10/10 passing) ✅
```  
- **V6 (Price Normalization)**: p₁ ≡ 1 and convergence criteria
#### Priority Validation Scenarios (When Import System Works)
- **V1 (Edgeworth 2×2)**: Analytical verification against known solution
- **V2 (Spatial Null)**: κ=0 should match Phase-1 exactly  
- **V6 (Price Normalization)**: p₁ ≡ 1 and convergence criteria
- **V10 (Integration Test)**: Fast unit test for economic pipeline

### Pull Request Process

1. **Branch**: Create feature branch from `main`
2. **Implement**: Follow coding standards and add tests
3. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass locally
4. **Document**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Review**: Submit PR with clear description

#### PR Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass (`make test`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`make format`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`mypy src/`)
- [ ] Economic invariants are preserved
- [ ] New features have tests
- [ ] Documentation is updated

### Common Implementation Patterns

#### Agent Management
```python
# Always use vectorized operations
endowments = np.array([agent.total_endowment for agent in agents])
positions = np.array([agent.position for agent in agents])

# Market participants only
market_agents = [agent for agent in agents if agent.in_marketplace]
```

#### Numerical Stability
```python
# Use tolerance constants from SPECIFICATION.md
from src.constants import SOLVER_TOL, FEASIBILITY_TOL

# Primary convergence test
assert np.linalg.norm(Z_market[1:], ord=np.inf) < SOLVER_TOL

# Conservation checks
assert abs(total_buys - total_sells) < FEASIBILITY_TOL
```

#### Configuration (When Imports Work)
```python
# Always load from YAML
import yaml
with open('config/scenario.yaml', 'r') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Use configurable marketplace size
market_width = config.get('market_width', 2)
market_height = config.get('market_height', 2)
```

## Economic Theory Guidelines (When Environment Works)

### Phase 1: Pure Walrasian
- Focus on equilibrium computation and analytical verification
- No spatial frictions (κ = 0)
- Perfect market clearing

### Phase 2: Spatial Extensions
- Local-participants equilibrium (post-move marketplace agents)
- Constrained execution (personal inventory limits)
- Money-metric welfare measurement

### Phase 3: Future Extensions
- Local price formation
- Bilateral bargaining
- Market microstructure

## Research Standards (Cannot Be Applied - Import System Broken)

### Data Products
- Log all simulation data to Parquet with schema versioning
- Include git SHA and config hash for reproducibility
- Use standardized sign conventions:
  - `z_market[g] = demand - endowment` (+ = excess demand)
  - `executed_net[g] = buys - sells` (+ = net buyer)

### Welfare Measurement
- Use money-metric utilities (equivalent variation)
- Pin to Phase-1 prices for interpersonal comparability
- Report in units of good 1 (numéraire)

### Validation
- Economic scenarios test theoretical properties
- Unit tests verify implementation correctness
- Performance tests ensure scalability targets

### Code Review Focus
Our reviews prioritize:
1. **Economic correctness**: Do the economics work as specified?
2. **Test coverage**: Are new features properly validated?
3. **Reproducibility**: Can others reproduce your results?
4. **Performance**: Does the code meet scalability targets?
5. **Documentation**: Are changes properly documented?

## Release Process

### Validation Requirements
Before any release:
- All validation scenarios (V1-V10) must pass
- Performance benchmarks must meet targets
- Documentation must be up-to-date
- Cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### Versioning
We use semantic versioning:
- **Major**: Breaking changes to economic model or API
- **Minor**: New features, additional validation scenarios
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, performance improvements
