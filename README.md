# Economic Simulation Vibe: Spatial Walrasian Markets

A research-grade economic simulation platform for studying spatial frictions in market economies. This project implements agent-based modeling of economic exchange with spatial constraints, movement costs, and centralized marketplace trading.

*Forked from the original econ_sim_base project.*

## 🎯 Current Development Status

### Production-Ready Economic Engine with Spatial Infrastructure

**PHASE 1 - COMPLETE ✅**:
- **Economic Engine**: Walrasian equilibrium solver with Cobb-Douglas utilities
- **Agent Framework**: Complete inventory management and utility maximization
- **Market Clearing**: Constrained execution with proportional rationing
- **Test Suite**: 84/84 tests passing (74 unit tests + 10 validation scenarios)
- **Package Configuration**: Working setup.py and pytest.ini for development

**PHASE 2 - PARTIAL 🚧**:
- **Spatial Grid**: Basic positioning and marketplace detection
- **Agent Movement**: Simple one-step movement toward marketplace
- **Simulation Runner**: Functional with YAML configuration support
- **Missing**: Travel cost budget integration (TODO placeholder exists)

### Implementation Status & Limitations

**✅ Complete & Production-Ready**:
- **Economic Engine**: Core agent framework, equilibrium solver, market clearing mechanisms
- **Test Framework**: 84/84 tests passing with comprehensive validation (V1-V10 scenarios)
- **Package Configuration**: Working setup.py, pytest.ini, requirements.txt

**⚠️ Partial Spatial Implementation**:
- **Basic Grid**: Simple one-step movement toward marketplace (no A* pathfinding)
- **Simulation Runner**: Functional and works with YAML configs
- **Missing**: Travel cost budget deduction (TODO placeholder only)
- **Convergence Issues**: Some spatial scenarios show equilibrium solver warnings

**❌ Missing Features**:
- **Travel Cost Budget Integration**: Movement costs configured but not deducted from agent wealth
- **A* Pathfinding**: Only basic one-step movement toward marketplace implemented
- **Parquet Logging**: Data logging hooks not implemented
- **LTE Price Integration**: Still uses global Walrasian pricing (Phase 2 gap)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

make validate

# Run specific simulation
python scripts/run_simulation.py --config config/edgeworth.yaml --seed 42
```

## Research Focus

This simulation studies **spatial deadweight loss** in economic markets:

- **Research Question**: How do movement costs (κ > 0) and marketplace access restrictions quantitatively reduce allocative efficiency compared to frictionless Walrasian outcomes?
- **Key Innovation**: Local-participants equilibrium pricing with constrained execution
- **Measurement**: Money-metric welfare loss (equivalent variation in numéraire units)

### Three-Phase Development

1. **Phase 1: Pure Walrasian** - ✅ Implemented: Frictionless baseline with perfect market clearing
2. **Phase 2: Spatial Extensions** - 🚧 Partial: Basic movement, marketplace access (planned: movement costs, full spatial analysis)
3. **Phase 3: Local Price Formation** - 📋 Planned: Bilateral bargaining, spatial price variation, advanced market mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Walrasian Solver**: Cobb-Douglas closed forms with numerical fallbacks
- **Spatial Grid**: Basic one-step movement on configurable grid
- **Market Clearing**: Constrained execution with carry-over order management
- **Welfare Measurement**: Money-metric utilities for interpersonal comparability

### Architecture Flow
```
Home ↔ Personal ↔ Market
 ω_h     ω_p      prices
   ↘       ↓        ↓
    total_endowment → price_computation (theoretical clearing)
           ↓
    personal_inventory → execution (constrained by personal stock)
           ↓
        rationing → carry-over
```
*Key insight: Prices reflect total endowments; execution limited by personal stock*

### Key Features
- **Reproducible**: Deterministic simulations with configurable random seeds
- **Scalable**: Target: 100+ agents with <30 seconds per 1000 rounds
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for utility functions and movement policies
- **Research-Grade**: Parquet logging, git SHA tracking, comprehensive validation

## Simulation Protocol

Each round follows the spatial Walrasian protocol:
1. **Agent Movement**: Move toward marketplace (Manhattan/L1; tie-break lexicographic by (x,y), then agent ID)
2. **Price Discovery**: Compute Local Theoretical Equilibrium (LTE) using **post-move** marketplace participants' total endowments
3. **Order Generation**: Each marketplace agent computes buy/sell orders
4. **Order Matching**: Execute trades constrained by personal inventory with proportional rationing
5. **State Update**: Record results, update positions and carry-over queues

**Termination**: Simulation stops at T ≤ 200 rounds, when all agents reach marketplace with total unmet demand/supply below tolerance for 5 consecutive rounds, or after max_stale_rounds without meaningful progress.

### Validation Framework

The project includes **10 comprehensive validation scenarios** with all tests passing:

**V1-V10 Scenarios (All Verified ✅)**:

| **V2: Spatial Null** | Friction-free baseline | ✅ PASS | `efficiency_loss < 1e-10` |
| **V3: Market Access** | Spatial efficiency loss | ✅ PASS | `efficiency_loss > 0.1` |
| **V4: Throughput Cap** | Market rationing effects | ✅ PASS | `uncleared_orders > 0` |
