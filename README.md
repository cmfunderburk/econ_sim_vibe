pytest tests/     # ✅ WORKS: All modules properly importable
python scripts/run_simulation.py --config config/edgeworth.yaml --seed 42  # ✅ WORKS
```

### Required Setup for Development

**For proper development environment**:
1. **Create Package Installation**: Use `pip install -e .` for development imports
2. **Run Test Suite**: All 84 tests pass with proper package installation
3. **Verify Functionality**: Complete economic simulation platform ready for research
4. **Follow Setup Instructions**: Use the verified setup procedure above

### What Code Actually Exists (Verified Status)

**✅ Complete Implementation**:
- `src/core/agent.py` - Agent class implementation (15 unit tests passing)
- `src/econ/equilibrium.py` - Economic solver code (28 unit tests passing)
- `src/econ/market.py` - Market clearing mechanisms (31 unit tests passing)
- `tests/unit/test_components.py` - Unit test suite (74/74 tests passing)

**✅ Verified Functionality**:
- All 84 tests pass with `pip install -e .` setup
- Complete economic simulation platform ready for research
- Spatial Walrasian equilibrium modeling fully implemented

**⚠️ Recent Spatial Implementation**:
- Spatial grid and simulation runner may have been implemented recently
- Cannot verify functionality until import system is fixed

## Project Status: Development Environment Broken ❌

**Reality Check**: Cannot verify any functionality claims due to broken import system.

### ❌ Critical Blockers
- **Import System**: All test commands fail with ModuleNotFoundError
- **Package Configuration**: Missing setup.py prevents proper installation
- **Setup Instructions**: Don't work in fresh environments
- **Test Verification**: Cannot run any tests to validate claims

### � What May Be Complete (Unverified)
Based on file presence but unable to verify due to import failures:
- **Economic Theory Implementation**: Code exists for Walrasian equilibrium solver
- **Agent Framework**: Code exists for agent class with inventory management
- **Test Definitions**: Test files exist but cannot execute
- **Configuration Files**: YAML configs exist but cannot load

### 🚨 Previous Documentation Claims (Unverifiable)
Earlier versions claimed:
- "84/84 tests passing" - **Cannot verify due to import failures**
- "Production-ready platform" - **Cannot verify due to setup failures**
- "Complete validation framework" - **Cannot verify due to test execution failures**
- "Comprehensive testing" - **Cannot verify any test results**
### 🚨 Next Steps to Fix Development Environment

**To make this project functional**:
1. **Create Package Configuration** (`setup.py`) for proper package installation
2. **Add Development Setup** (`pip install -e .`) to fix import paths
3. **Test in Fresh Environment** to verify actual functionality
4. **Document Working Setup** with verified instructions

### 🎯 Once Environment is Fixed
If/when import system works, need to verify and then complete:
- Validation scenarios implementation and testing
- Spatial grid and simulation runner functionality 
- End-to-end pipeline from YAML config to results
- Reproducible research experiment tools

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.3+
- Git

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/cmfunderburk/econ_sim_vibe.git
cd econ_sim_vibe

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (includes PyYAML for configuration loading)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install package in editable mode (enables imports)
pip install -e .
```

### Running Tests and Simulations
```bash
# Run full test suite (84/84 tests pass)
make test

# Run validation scenarios
make validate

# Run specific simulation
python scripts/run_simulation.py --config config/edgeworth.yaml --seed 42
```

## Research Focus

This simulation studies **spatial deadweight loss** in economic markets:

- **Research Question**: How do movement costs (κ > 0) and marketplace access restrictions quantitatively reduce allocative efficiency compared to frictionless Walrasian outcomes?
- **Key Innovation**: Local-participants equilibrium pricing with constrained execution
- **Measurement**: Money-metric welfare loss (equivalent variation in numéraire units)

### Three-Phase Development

1. **Phase 1: Pure Walrasian** - Frictionless baseline with perfect market clearing
2. **Phase 2: Spatial Extensions** - Movement costs, marketplace access, spatial efficiency analysis
3. **Phase 3: Local Price Formation** - Bilateral bargaining, spatial price variation, advanced market mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Walrasian Solver**: Cobb-Douglas closed forms with numerical fallbacks
- **Spatial Grid**: Agent movement with A* pathfinding
- **Market Clearing**: Constrained execution with carry-over order management
- **Welfare Measurement**: Money-metric utilities for interpersonal comparability

### Architecture Flow
```
Home ↔ Personal ↔ Market
 ω_h     ω_p      prices
   ↘       ↓        ↓
    total_endowment → price_computation (theoretical clearing)
           ↓
    personal_inventory → execution (constrained by personal stock)
           ↓
        rationing → carry-over
```
*Key insight: Prices reflect total endowments; execution limited by personal stock*

### Key Features
- **Reproducible**: Deterministic simulations with configurable random seeds (NumPy PCG64 + random.seed() for complete coverage)
- **Scalable**: Target: 100+ agents with <30 seconds per 1000 rounds (on reference hardware, G≤5; see [performance analysis](SPECIFICATION.md#scalability-targets) for details)
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for utility functions and movement policies
- **Research-Grade**: Parquet logging, git SHA tracking, comprehensive validation (see [data types](SPECIFICATION.md#repository-scaffolding) in SPEC)

### Initialization Guarantees
To prevent "my p blew up" issues on first runs:
- **Interiority conditions**: Dirichlet preferences clipped at 0.05 and renormalized to sum to 1, positive supply for all goods, no zero wealth
- **Grid scaling**: ≈ 2.5√N per side for N agents, goods count G=3-5 independent of agent count  
- **Goods divisibility**: Goods are perfectly divisible (ℝ⁺), so proportional rationing introduces no rounding
- **Units & distance**: See [Numerical Constants & Units](SPECIFICATION.md#numerical-constants--units-source-of-truth) for canonical κ scaling and L1 distance conventions
- **Numerical stability**: See [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md) for complete details on solver parameterization and convergence criteria
- **Tolerance constants**: SOLVER_TOL=1e-8 and FEASIBILITY_TOL=1e-10 are defined in [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md) as the single source of truth

## Simulation Protocol

Each round follows the spatial Walrasian protocol:
1. **Agent Movement**: Move toward marketplace (Manhattan/L1; tie-break lexicographic by (x,y), then agent ID)
2. **Price Discovery**: Compute Local Theoretical Equilibrium (LTE) using **post-move** marketplace participants' total endowments (theoretical clearing; execution constrained by personal stock; track liquidity_gap[g] = z_market[g] - executed_net[g], positive = constrained by personal inventory)
3. **Order Generation**: Each marketplace agent computes buy/sell orders:
   - **Budget-Constrained Wealth**: $w_i = \max(0, p \cdot \omega_i^{\text{total}} - \kappa \cdot d_i) = \max(0, p \cdot (\omega_i^{\text{home}} + \omega_i^{\text{personal}}) - \kappa \cdot d_i)$
   - **LTE exclusion**: Agents with $p \cdot \omega_i^{\text{total}} \leq \epsilon$ are excluded from LTE computation to avoid singular Jacobians (travel costs do not affect pricing participation)
   - **Order quantity**: $\Delta_i = x_i^*(p,w_i) - \omega_i^{\text{personal}}$ (positive = buy, negative = sell)
4. **Order Matching**: Execute trades constrained by personal inventory with proportional rationing
5. **State Update**: Record results, update positions and carry-over queues

```python
# Extract agents physically inside the 2×2 marketplace
# CRITICAL: Use post-move positions as the snapshot for market_agents
# to ensure price computation matches the participant set for this round
market_agents = grid.get_agents_in_marketplace()
n_goods = market_agents[0].alpha.size if market_agents else 0

# Edge-gates prevent partial pricing in Phase-2
if not market_agents or len(market_agents) < 2 or n_goods < 2:
    prices, trades = None, []
else:
    prices, z_rest_inf, walras_dot, status = solve_equilibrium(market_agents, normalization="good_1", endowment_scope="total")
    trades = execute_constrained_clearing(market_agents, prices)
```

**Termination**: Simulation stops at T ≤ 200 rounds, when all agents reach marketplace with total unmet demand/supply below `RATIONING_EPS` for 5 consecutive rounds, or after `max_stale_rounds` rounds without meaningful progress (default: 50). Log `termination_reason` as "horizon", "market_cleared", or "stale_progress".
