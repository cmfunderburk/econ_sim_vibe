# Economic Simulation Project

The goal of this project is to create a modular simulation of an economy using agent-based modeling with rigorous economic theory foundations. This project follows a pedagogical progression from pure Walrasian general equilibrium theory to realistic spatial market mechanisms.

## Project Vision

This project builds a comprehensive economic modeling platform step-by-step from economic first principles:
1. **Phase 1**: Pure exchange economy (Walrasian equilibrium)
2. **Phase 2**: Spatial extensions with global prices
3. **Phase 3**: Local price formation and market mechanisms
4. **Future**: Production, money, institutions, and behavioral economics

## Economic Theory Framework

### Phase 1: Pure Exchange Economy (Walrasian)
- **Pure barter economy**: No money, all trades are goods-for-goods exchanges
- **Global price vector**: Computed by solving aggregate excess demand = 0
- **Perfect information**: All agents know all prices instantly  
- **No spatial frictions**: Focus on utility maximization and efficiency
- **Market clearing**: ∑ᵢ zᵢ(p) = 0 where zᵢ is agent i's excess demand
- **Budget constraint**: p·x ≤ p·ω (consumption value ≤ endowment value)
- **Welfare theorems**: Competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient

### Phase 2: Spatial Extensions (Current Implementation)
- **Static intra-round pricing**: Walrasian prices computed fresh each round, no intra-round dynamics
- **Inter-round price evolution**: Prices may change across rounds as participant set and endowments evolve
- **Grid-based movement**: Agents travel with explicit movement costs affecting utility
- **Market access restriction**: Only agents inside marketplace can trade
- **LTE (Local Theoretical Equilibrium)**: Prices computed only from agents currently in marketplace
- **Research objective**: Measure spatial deadweight loss via money-metric welfare analysis

### Phase 3: Local Price Formation (Future)
- **Dynamic price discovery**: Prices emerge from local trading mechanisms
- **Bilateral bargaining**: Nash bargaining solution for co-located agents
- **Marketplace auctions**: Continuous double auction mechanism
- **Spatial price variation**: Prices differ across locations and time
- **Market microstructure**: Order books, bid-ask spreads, market makers

## Notation Reference

**Core Symbols:**
- $x$ = consumption bundle (post-trade)
- $\omega^{\text{home}}$ = home inventory (strategic storage)
- $\omega^{\text{personal}}$ = personal inventory (tradeable at marketplace)
- $\omega^{\text{total}} = \omega^{\text{home}} + \omega^{\text{personal}}$ = total endowment
- $p$ = price vector with $p_1 \equiv 1$ (numéraire)
- $Z$ = excess demand vector ($Z = \text{demand} - \text{endowment}$)
- $d$ = distance traveled (Manhattan/L1 metric)
- $\kappa$ = movement cost per step (units of good 1)

## Quick Reference for Contributors

**Key Invariants (Never Violate):**
- p₁ ≡ 1 (numéraire constraint)
- ||Z_market(p)_{2:n}||_∞ < SOLVER_TOL (primary convergence criterion)
- ∑ᵢ executed_buys_g = ∑ᵢ executed_sells_g (conservation per good)
- Per-agent: buy_value ≤ sell_value (value feasibility per round)

**Critical Round Order:**
1. Move → 2. Price (post-move participants) → 3. Clear (constrained by personal inventory)

**Common Implementation Pitfalls:**
- Using `len(prices)` instead of `agents[0].alpha.size` for n_goods
- Pricing before movement (violates local-participants principle)
- Forgetting personal inventory constraints in clearing algorithm
- Using Walras' Law |p·Z_market(p)| instead of rest-goods norm ||Z_market(p)_{2:n}||_∞ for convergence

## Numerical Constants & Units (Source of Truth)

### Convergence & Numerical Tolerances
- **SOLVER_TOL = 1e-8**: Primary convergence criterion for rest-goods norm ||Z_market(p)_{2:n}||_∞
- **FEASIBILITY_TOL = 1e-10**: All feasibility and conservation checks (value feasibility, market balance)
- **RATIONING_EPS = 1e-10**: Prevent division by zero in proportional rationing (max(B_g, ε) denominators)
- **Walras validation**: Uses SOLVER_TOL for sanity check |p·Z_market(p)| < 1e-8

### Distance & Travel Cost Units
- **Distance metric**: Manhattan/L1 metric on grid (1 unit per step, 4-directional movement)
- **κ units**: Denominated in units of good 1 per grid step (budget-side deduction only)
- **Tie-breaking**: Lexicographic by (x,y) coordinates then agent ID for deterministic pathfinding
- **EV reporting**: All equivalent variation values in units of good 1 (numéraire)

## Architecture Overview

- **Performance Target**: Scalable to 100+ agents with vectorized numpy operations
- **Extensible Framework**: Plugin system for utility functions, market mechanisms, and economic institutions
- **Theoretical Grounding**: All components connect to established economic theory
- **Real-time Visualization**: Pygame-based visualization of agent movement and trading
- **System Flow**: See [README.md](README.md) for ASCII diagram of Home ↔ Personal ↔ Market architecture

## Budget Constraints and Market Structure

### Pure Barter Economy with Numéraire
- **No physical money**: All trades are direct goods-for-goods exchanges
- **Numéraire choice**: Good 1 serves as numéraire with p₁ ≡ 1 for price normalization
- **Budget constraint**: ∑ⱼ pⱼxᵢⱼ ≤ ∑ⱼ pⱼωᵢⱼ (expenditure ≤ income in numéraire units)
- **Price vector**: p = (1, p₂, p₃, ..., pₙ) where only relative prices matter
- **Market clearing**: ∑ᵢ xᵢⱼ = ∑ᵢ ωᵢⱼ for all goods simultaneously
- **Walrasian auctioneer**: Marketplace facilitates multilateral clearing, holds no inventory

### Home Inventory Specification (Phase 2 Neutral)
- **No strategic withholding**: LTE price formation uses **total endowment (home + personal)** for theoretical clearing; execution constrained by personal stock
- **Execution constraint**: Trading limited by **personal inventory** present in marketplace
- **Rationing**: Unmet demand/supply rationed proportionally and logged as carry-over; track liquidity_gap[g] = z_market[g] - executed_net[g]. **Critical**: Carry-over is diagnostic only.
- **Carry-over repricing**: Unexecuted orders repriced at next round's equilibrium vector. **Critical**: Carry-over queues **never auto-execute**; orders are recomputed from scratch each round and carry-over is diagnostic only.
- **Free transfer**: Agents can move goods between personal/home when co-located with home

### Movement Cost Model
We adopt a **budget-side travel cost model** for Phase 2:
- **Travel budget**: $w_i = \max(0, p \cdot \omega_i^{total} - \kappa \cdot d_i)$ where $d_i$ is distance traveled this round
- **Travel cost treatment**: Movement costs are deducted from wealth as consumption of good 1 (numéraire), preserving utility's ordinal nature
- **Distance metric**: Manhattan/L1 metric on grid (1 unit per step, 4-directional movement)
- **Tie-breaking**: Lexicographic by (x,y) coordinates then agent ID for deterministic pathfinding across platforms
- **Unit consistency**: $\kappa$ is denominated in units of good 1 per grid step, ensuring budget constraint consistency
- **Default settings**: $\kappa = 0$ in validation scenarios V1-V3 (spatial null tests)
- **Movement policy**: Default movement is **myopic A*** to the nearest marketplace cell; $\kappa$ is applied as a budget reduction. **Note**: A* optimality requires static, additive, non-negative costs without congestion - gated by regime flags in implementation. Intertemporal trade-offs and strategic rerouting are introduced in Phase 3.

### Welfare Measurement
- **Money-metric welfare**: Report equivalent variation (EV) in units of good 1 (numéraire) using expenditure functions to ensure interpersonal comparability
- **Baseline comparison**: EV measured relative to Phase 1 frictionless allocation
- **EV formula**: EV computed in money space at Phase-1 numéraire-normalized price vector p* (with p*₁=1): EVᵢ = e(p*, x_i^{Phase2}) - e(p*, x_i^{Phase1}) where Phase-2 consumption bundles computed using budget-constrained demand with w_i = max(0, p·ω_i^{total} - κ·d_i). Efficiency loss is ∑ᵢ EVᵢ.
- **Budget constraint**: Phase 2 demand uses budget w_i = max(0, p·ω_i^{total} - κ·d_i) ensuring travel costs are incorporated as budget-side deductions in numéraire units
- **Interpretation**: "Spatial deadweight loss = X units of good 1 foregone"

### Walrasian Solver Implementation

#### Price Normalization:
- **Numéraire choice**: Good 1 as numéraire (p₁ ≡ 1)
- **Solver target**: Find p₂, p₃, ..., pₙ such that excess demand = 0
- **Homogeneity**: All agents have homogeneous degree 0 preferences (price level irrelevant)
- **Residual threshold**: **Primary stop** uses ||Z_market(p)_{2:n}||_∞ < SOLVER_TOL (rest-goods system). The Walras dot |p·Z_market(p)| is a **sanity check on the theoretical system** using participants' **total** endowments; executed trades may differ due to personal-inventory constraints and rationing.

#### Cobb-Douglas Closed Forms:
For agent i with utility Uᵢ(x) = ∏ⱼ xⱼ^αᵢⱼ and ∑ⱼ αᵢⱼ = 1:
- **Demand**: xᵢⱼ(p, ωᵢ) = αᵢⱼ · (p·ωᵢ) / pⱼ
- **Excess demand system**: Z(p) = ∑ᵢ [x_i(p, ω_i^total) - ω_i^total] where ω_i^total = ω_i^home + ω_i^personal

```python
def compute_excess_demand(prices, participant_agents):
    assert participant_agents, "No participants in market this round"
    eps = 1e-10
    prices = np.maximum(prices, eps)  # Guard against division by zero/negative prices (p₁≡1 by normalization, floors apply to j>1)
    n_goods = participant_agents[0].alpha.size
    total_demand = np.zeros(n_goods)
    total_endowment = np.zeros(n_goods)
    
    for agent in participant_agents:  # Only marketplace participants
        omega_total = agent.home_endowment + agent.personal_endowment
        wealth = float(np.dot(prices, omega_total))
        
        # Cobb-Douglas demand: x_ij = alpha_ij * wealth / p_j
        demand = agent.alpha * wealth / prices
        
        total_demand += demand
        total_endowment += omega_total
    
    return total_demand - total_endowment  # Z(p)
```

#### Phase-1 Optimizations:
- **Closed-form expenditure function**: For Cobb-Douglas, $e(p,u) = u \prod_j p_j^{\alpha_j}$ avoids per-agent numerical minimization during EV validation
- **Enhanced solver return**: Optionally return `(p, Z)` so validation can log rest-goods residual without recomputation

#### Fallback for General Utilities:
If a utility plugin doesn't provide `demand()`, solver falls back to numerical utility maximization per agent with tolerance 1e-6 and box constraints x ≥ 0.

#### Solver Stability:
- **Walras' Law**: p·Z(p) ≡ 0 by construction (budget constraints sum to zero)
- **Gross substitutes**: Cobb-Douglas satisfies this (ensures unique equilibrium)
- **Fallback**: Tâtonnement with adaptive step size if fsolve fails

- **Price floors**: Enforce pⱼ ≥ ε via log-price optimization or simplex projection with p₁≡1 and pⱼ>ε for j>1
- **Warm starts**: Use previous round solution p^(t-1) as initial guess for fsolve
- **Endowment scaling**: Scale endowments to mean=1 per good to stabilize Jacobians
### Trading Mechanism (Phase 2: Clean Spatial Protocol)

#### Static Equilibrium Process Per Round:
1. **Agent Movement**: Each agent moves one grid square toward marketplace (myopic A*, Manhattan/L1; lexicographic tie-break by (x,y), then agent ID)

2. **Local Theoretical Equilibrium (LTE)**: Compute the Walrasian price vector using **POST-MOVE agents inside the marketplace** and their **total endowments (home + personal)**. This establishes the theoretical clearing prices; actual execution will be constrained by personal inventory. Agents outside the marketplace are excluded from this round's Z_market(p) = 0 system.

3. **Market Access Gate**: Only agents physically inside the 2×2 marketplace can submit trading orders

4. **Order Generation**: Each POST-MOVE marketplace agent submits demand-based orders: For Cobb-Douglas agents, order quantity for good j is `x_ij = alpha_ij * w_i / p_j` minus current personal inventory. Positive = buy order, negative = sell order.

   **Budget-Constrained Wealth**: $w_i = \max(0, p \cdot \omega_i^{\text{total}} - \kappa \cdot d_i) = \max(0, p \cdot (\omega_i^{\text{home}} + \omega_i^{\text{personal}}) - \kappa \cdot d_i)$; **travel-adjusted budget sizes orders only**. **LTE exclusion** is based on **total wealth**: agents with $p \cdot \omega_i^{\text{total}} \leq \epsilon$ are excluded from LTE computation to avoid singular Jacobians (travel costs do not affect pricing participation). Orders use $\Delta_i = x_i^*(p,w_i) - \omega_i^{\text{personal}}$ to determine buy/sell quantities, with execution still limited by personal stock and value feasibility.

5. **Constrained Clearing**: Execute trades at equilibrium prices, limited by personal inventory present in marketplace. Ration unmet orders proportionally by requested quantity.

6. **Carry-over Management**: Unexecuted orders logged as carry-over (quantities only), repriced at next round's equilibrium. **Important**: Carry-over queues do NOT finance current buys; they are informational/diagnostic and repriced next round only.

7. **State Update**: New endowment distribution becomes input for next round

#### Why This Design:
- **Local Theoretical Equilibrium (LTE)**: Prices reflect what full clearing would be using participants' total endowments, establishing theoretical benchmark
- **Liquidity constraints**: Execution limited by personal inventory creates measurable liquidity gap between theoretical and actual trades
- **Spatial friction bites**: Distance to marketplace creates real efficiency costs  
- **Clean measurement**: Compare money-metric welfare with/without movement costs, tracking both LTE and execution gaps
- **No arbitrage confusion**: Single trading mechanism with clear participation rules
- **Pedagogical clarity**: Students see pure effect of spatial access constraints

### Market Throughput & Rationing (Optional Extensions)

#### Throughput Caps:
- **Market capacity**: Auctioneer can clear at most Qₘₐₓ units per good per round
- **Rationing rule**: Proportional to requested quantity; deterministic tie-breakers by agent ID
- **Carry-over persistence**: Quantities only, repriced at next round's equilibrium vector. **Settlement timing**: Carry-over does NOT finance current trades; purely informational until repriced next round.
- **Creates time pressure**: Agents must consider market congestion in movement decisions
- **Configuration requirement**: Set `enable_capacity: false` by default and require `regime: "static_additive_no_congestion"` when true, with tests that relax A* optimality claims accordingly

**⚠️ Note**: Throughput caps create disequilibrium conditions, pushing toward Phase 3 territory. **Enabling caps introduces queueing and non-clearing markets** - avoid during baseline Phase-2 experiments.

## Core Components (Phase 2 Implementation)

The spatial extension maintains Walrasian equilibrium pricing while adding movement and location constraints:

1. **The Agents ("Homo Economicus")**
    i. Each agent has a preference relation represented by a utility function
    ii. Each agent has a personal inventory (carried goods, used for trading)
    iii. Each agent has a home with storage inventory (cannot be traded remotely)
    iv. Each agent has a unique numerical ID, starting at 1
    v. **Trading Rules**: 
        - **Market access only**: Agents can trade only when physically inside the 2×2 marketplace
        - **Local equilibrium prices**: Trades execute at prices computed from current marketplace participants
        - **No bilateral trading**: Eliminates arbitrage channels and path-dependence
        - **Movement costs**: $\kappa \cdot d_i$ budget-side deduction in good-1 per distance unit traveled

2. Agent's Home
    i. Each agent's home is initialized with an inventory described in section 5.
    ii. While in their home, agents can freely transfer items between their own inventory and their home inventory.

3. **Marketplace (Walrasian Auctioneer)**
    i. The marketplace is the center-most rectangle of configurable size (default: 2×2 portion of the NxN grid)
    
    **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    [config]
    market_width: 2
    market_height: 2
    # The marketplace is the central rectangle of size market_width × market_height.
    # Edge-gates, access checks, and distance_to_market use these dimensions.
    ```
    
    ii. **Local auctioneer**: Computes equilibrium using only current marketplace participants
    iii. **Clearing mechanism**: All buy/sell orders execute simultaneously at equilibrium prices (trades may be rationed by inventory constraints)
    iv. **Rationing**: Proportional allocation when personal inventory insufficient

4. **NxN Grid**
    i. Grid dimensions: Configurable (default: ≈ 2.5√N per side for N agents)
    ii. Agents move one square per turn with movement cost $\kappa$ per unit distance

5. **Goods**
    i. Number of good types: Configurable (default: G=3 to G=5, independent of agent count)
    ii. Total quantity per good: Configurable (default: balanced allocation ensuring interior solutions)
    iii. Initial allocation: Randomly distributed to agent homes at initialization

6. **Preference Generator & Utility Functions**
    i. **Extensible Framework**: Plugin system for different utility functional forms
    ii. **Initial Implementation**: Cobb-Douglas with randomized preference weights
    iii. **Closed-form optimization**: Use analytical demand functions when available

### Initialization Guarantees (Interiority Conditions)
- **Cobb-Douglas preferences**: Draw α from Dirichlet(1,...,1) with clip αⱼ ≥ 0.05 to ensure all goods valued; **renormalize α to sum to 1 after clipping** to preserve Cobb-Douglas formulas
- **Positive supply**: Ensure each good has positive total supply and at least one unit held by some marketplace-reachable agent
- **Endowment distribution**: Random allocation to agent homes ensuring no agent starts with zero wealth at Phase-1 equilibrium prices

## Simulation Flow (Phase 2: Spatial Walrasian)

### Static Equilibrium Approach
The simulation implements a spatial extension of Walrasian equilibrium using a clean protocol that makes spatial frictions measurable:

### Each Simulation Round:
1. **Agent Movement**: Move one square toward marketplace (myopic A*, Manhattan/L1; tie-break lexicographic by (x,y), then agent ID)
2. **Local-Participants Price Computation**: Solve ∑ᵢ∈marketplace zᵢ(p) = 0 using **post-move** marketplace agents' total endowments only
3. **Market Order Submission**: Only marketplace agents can submit buy/sell orders
4. **Constrained Clearing**: Execute at equilibrium prices, ration by personal inventory constraints
5. **Carry-over Logging**: Record unexecuted quantities for next round (repriced). **Critical**: Carry-over is diagnostic only, repriced next round, never finances current buys.
6. **State Update**: Update positions, inventories, and welfare measurements

**Termination**: Simulation stops at T ≤ 200 rounds, when all agents reach marketplace with total unmet demand/supply below `RATIONING_EPS` for 5 consecutive rounds, or after `max_stale_rounds` rounds without meaningful progress (default: 50). Log `termination_reason` as "horizon", "market_cleared", or "stale_progress".

### Key Properties:
- **Consistent economics**: LTE price formation uses marketplace participants' total endowments for theoretical clearing; execution constrained by personal inventory
- **Pure spatial friction**: Efficiency loss comes solely from movement costs and market access
- **Measurable welfare effects**: Money-metric equivalent variation in numéraire units
- **No strategic behavior**: Phase 2 neutralizes inventory management via total endowment pricing for LTE computation

### Simulation Objective: Spatial Efficiency Analysis
**Research Question**: How do movement costs and marketplace access restrictions reduce allocative efficiency compared to frictionless Walrasian outcome?

**Measurements**:
- **Efficiency loss**: Money-metric welfare loss (equivalent variation in numéraire units)
- **Travel patterns**: Analyze agent movement strategies and convergence to marketplace
- **Welfare distribution**: Measure how spatial costs affect different agent types
- **Market utilization**: Track marketplace occupancy and queueing patterns

**What Phase 2 Studies**: Pure deadweight loss from spatial separation, optimal market placement, movement cost sensitivity

**What Phase 2 Does NOT Study**: Price discovery, learning, disequilibrium dynamics, strategic behavior (reserved for Phase 3)

## Economic Validation Framework

### Phase 1 (Pure Walrasian) Validation:
- **Equilibrium prices**: Primary convergence: ||Z(p)_{2:n}||_∞ < 1e-8 (rest-goods system); Sanity check: |p·Z(p)| < 1e-8 (Walras' Law validation)
- **Walras' Law**: p·Z(p) < 1e-8 (budget constraints sum to zero)
- **Individual rationality**: Each agent maximizes utility subject to budget constraint
- **Pareto efficiency**: No allocation exists that improves someone without harming others
- **Conservation**: Total goods conserved: ∑ᵢ xᵢ = ∑ᵢ ωᵢ (across all executed trades)

*Primary stop uses ||Z_market(p)_{2:n}||_∞ < SOLVER_TOL. The Walras dot |p·Z_market(p)| is a **sanity check on the theoretical system** using participants' **total** endowments; executed trades may differ due to personal-inventory constraints and rationing.*

### Phase 2 (Spatial Extension) Validation:
- **Spatial efficiency**: Money-metric welfare loss ≥ 0 compared to Phase 1
- **Access restriction**: Only marketplace agents execute trades (verify no bilateral trades)
- **Price consistency (theoretical)**: **Primary stop** uses ||Z_market(p)_{2:n}||_∞ < SOLVER_TOL. The Walras dot |p·Z_market(p)| is a **sanity check on the theoretical system** using participants' **total** endowments; executed trades may differ due to personal-inventory constraints and rationing.
- **Movement optimality (static regime only)**: Myopic A* pathfinding is optimal under current cost model (additive, static, nonnegative costs, no congestion). **Warning**: Optimality fails with capacity constraints, dynamic participation, or throughput limitations - use regression tests to validate regime assumptions.
- **Conservation**: Goods conserved across locations, agents, marketplace, and carry-over queues (carry-over diagnostic only)

### Validation Scenarios

| Scenario | Config | Expected Outcome | Numeric Check |
|----------|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **V1: Edgeworth 2×2** | `config/edgeworth.yaml` | Analytic equilibrium match | `‖p_computed - p_analytic‖ < 1e-8` |
| **V2: Spatial Null** | `config/zero_movement_cost.yaml` | Phase 2 = Phase 1 exactly | `efficiency_loss < 1e-10` |
| **V3: Market Access** | `config/small_market.yaml` | Efficiency loss vs. baseline | `efficiency_loss > 0.1 units of good 1` (threshold may vary by seed; verify direction and magnitude) |
| **V4: Throughput Cap** | `config/rationed_market.yaml` | Queue formation, carry-over orders | `uncleared_orders > 0` (carry-over diagnostic only) |
| **V5: Spatial Dominance** | `config/infinite_movement_cost.yaml` | Phase 2 efficiency ≤ Phase 1 | `spatial_welfare ≤ walrasian_welfare` |
| **V6: Price Normalization** | `config/price_validation.yaml` | p₁ ≡ 1 and rest-goods convergence | `p[0] == 1.0 and ||Z_market(p)[1:]||_∞ < 1e-8` |
| **V7: Empty Marketplace** | `config/empty_market.yaml` | Skip price computation and clearing | `prices == None and trades == []` |
| **V8: Stop Conditions** | `config/termination.yaml` | Horizon, market clearing, or stale progress | `T <= 200 or (all_at_market and total_unmet_demand < RATIONING_EPS for 5 rounds) or stale_rounds >= max_stale_rounds` |
| **V9: Scale Invariance** | `config/scale_test.yaml` | Price scaling preserves allocation | Multiply p by c>0, renormalize p₁≡1, assert identical demand |
| **V10: Spatial Null (Unit Test)** | `config/spatial_null_test.yaml` | κ=0, all agents at market initially | `phase2_allocation == phase1_allocation and efficiency_loss < FEASIBILITY_TOL` |


**EV Measurement**: All efficiency_loss values computed in money space at Phase-1 p* with p*₁=1: EV_i = e(p*, x_i^{Phase2}) - e(p*, x_i^{Phase1}) where Phase-2 consumption bundles computed using budget-constrained demand with w_i = max(0, p·ω_i^{total} - κ·d_i). Report Σᵢ EVᵢ in units of good 1.

#### Per-Agent Budget Feasibility Test:
For each round and agent, derive value of executed buys vs sells at equilibrium prices p from Parquet log and assert:
```python
def test_per_agent_budget_feasibility():
    for round_data in simulation_log:
        for agent_id in round_data.executed_trades:
            buy_value = sum(p[g] * executed_buys[agent_id][g] for g in goods)
            sell_value = sum(p[g] * executed_sells[agent_id][g] for g in goods)
            assert buy_value <= sell_value + tolerance  # value feasibility per round
```

#### Critical Edge Cases (Implementation Must Handle):
- **Empty marketplace**: `market_agents = []` → `prices = None, trades = []` (skip price computation and clearing; log "no-price" round)
- **Single participant**: `len(market_agents) < 2` → skip pricing (requires ≥2 agents for meaningful equilibrium)
- **Single good**: `n_goods < 2` → skip pricing (numéraire degeneracy - need ≥2 goods for relative prices)
- **Zero personal inventory**: Agent at marketplace but no goods to trade → valid participant for pricing, but generates empty orders
- **Order priority**: Pro-rata rationing with deterministic tie-breaking by agent ID
- **Order invalidation**: If personal stock changes before execution, invalidate stale orders

#### Settlement Timing:
**CRITICAL**: All order validation uses market-entry inventory snapshots. Personal inventory snapshots are taken at **market entry** time each round. Any mid-round inventory changes invalidate pending orders.

#### Running Validation:
```bash
pytest tests/validation/ --config config/edgeworth.yaml
python scripts/validate_scenario.py --all --output results/validation/
```

### Data Products & Reproducibility

### Structured Logging Schema
Per-round Parquet files with columns:
- **Schema**: `schema_version: "1.0.0"` (increment on breaking changes)
- **Identifiers**: `round, agent_id, timestamp`
- **Inventories**: `x_home[g], x_personal[g], x_total[g]` for each good g
- **Spatial**: `pos_x, pos_y, in_marketplace, distance_to_market` (minimum Manhattan/L1 distance to **any** marketplace cell, using configurable market_width × market_height)
- **Financing snapshots**: `personal_at_entry[g], wealth_at_pricing, in_market_bool` (prevent mid-round financing mutations)
- **Economics**: `p[g], z_market[g], executed_net[g], liquidity_gap[g], utility, move_cost, equivalent_variation`
- **LTE vs Execution**: `z_market[g]` (theoretical excess demand under total endowments) vs `executed_net[g]` (actual executed net trades) vs `liquidity_gap[g] = z_market[g] - executed_net[g]` (first-class liquidity constraint measure)
- **Sign conventions**: `z_market[g] = demand - endowment` (+ = excess demand), `executed_net[g] = buys - sells` (+ = net buyer), `liquidity_gap[g] > 0` = constrained by personal inventory
- **Termination tracking**: `termination_reason` ("horizon", "market_cleared", "stale_progress") logged in final round
- **Metadata**: `git_sha, config_hash, random_seed`

### Reproducibility Guarantees
- **Configuration**: Every experiment via `python scripts/run_simulation.py --config path.yaml --seed 42`
- **Deterministic**: Fixed random seeds with reproducible numpy/scipy versions, plus `random.seed(seed)` for Python RNG coverage
- **Cross-machine stability**: `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS=1` and NumPy `PCG64` with fixed seeds to reduce solver jitter
- **Headless**: `--no-gui` mode for batch experiments and CI/CD
- **Analysis**: `make figures` regenerates all plots from Parquet logs
- **Version control**: Git SHA and dependency versions logged with each run

## Performance Optimization

### Computational Bottlenecks
- **Per-round equilibrium**: Profile equilibrium solver; **⚠️ WARNING: Price caching across rounds violates local-participants consistency; only use with --frozen-participation flag**
- **A* pathfinding**: Precompute distance field to marketplace, use greedy descent for ~O(N) speedup
- **Vectorized operations**: All agent properties as numpy arrays for 100+ agent performance

### Scalability Targets
- **Agent count**: Target 100+ agents with <30 seconds per 1000 rounds (reference hardware, G≤5)
- **Memory efficiency**: Pre-allocated arrays, minimal copying
- **Warm starts**: Use previous equilibrium as initial guess for fsolve

### Default Configuration Parameters
- **Goods count**: G ∈ {2,...,5} for most educational scenarios; single high-G stress config for performance testing. Goods are perfectly divisible (ℝ⁺), so proportional rationing introduces no rounding.
- **Grid size**: Default formula: `grid_side = max(15, ceil(2.5 * sqrt(n_agents)))` to decouple from agent count
- **Stop conditions**: Default horizon T=200 rounds, earlier if all agents reached marketplace and total unmet demand/supply below `RATIONING_EPS` for 5 consecutive rounds, or after `max_stale_rounds` without progress (default: 50). **Note**: Uses actual market clearing metrics, not carry-over state.
- **Price caching**: For profiling only - caveat that cached prices risk inconsistency when marketplace participation changes

```

**Numerical Stability Guidelines:**
- **Primary convergence test**: ||Z(p)_{2:n}||_∞ < 1e-8 (the "rest-goods" system), not just |p·Z(p)| (Walras' Law can be near-zero away from equilibrium)
- **Parameterization**: Optimize in log-price space with p₁ ≡ 1 to enforce positivity without manual clipping; **primary positivity enforcement** through log-parameterization
- **Warm starts**: Start from p^{t-1} and rescale endowments to mean 1 per good for numerical conditioning
- **Initial prices**: Start with uniform prices (all goods equal value) for robust convergence. **For the very first round** when no prior prices exist, use `np.ones(n_goods-1)` as the initial guess for the rest-goods vector p_{2:n}, ensuring p₁ ≡ 1 normalization.
- **Bounds checking**: Enforce p ≥ 1e-10 as **last-ditch safety guard** to prevent numerical degeneracy when log-param fails
- **Jacobian conditioning**: Use regularization if condition number > 1e12
- **Algorithm recommendation**: Newton-Raphson for smooth Cobb-Douglas, gradient descent for general utilities

**Failure Modes & Remedies:**
- **fsolve fails**: Fall back to tâtonnement with adaptive step size
- **Negative price after log-param**: Project back to feasible region
- **NaN/Inf guard**: If Z_market(p) or p contains NaN/Inf, reset to uniform prices, halve the tâtonnement step size, and retry from the last feasible iterate
- **Queue growth without bound**: Raise throughput warning and consider capacity constraints

```python
def execute_constrained_clearing(agents: List[Agent], prices: np.ndarray,

       (Cobb-Douglas: x_ij = alpha_ij * wealth / p_j minus current personal inventory)
    2. Separate buy/sell orders by sign
    3. For each good j:

       b. Execute buys up to min(total_buy_orders_j, executed_sells_j, capacity_j)
       c. If demand exceeds supply: ration buy orders proportionally by requested quantity
       d. If supply exceeds demand: ration sell orders proportionally by offered quantity
    4. Log unexecuted order quantities as carry-over for next round (repriced at future equilibrium). **Critical**: Carry-over is diagnostic only, repriced next round, never finances current buys.
    5. Return list of executed trades with (agent_id, good_id, quantity, price) tuples

### Economic Invariants
All implementations must satisfy:
- **Nonnegativity**: x ≥ 0 for all consumption bundles
- **Conservation**: ∑ᵢ xᵢ = ∑ᵢ ωᵢ before and after all operations
- **Budget feasibility**: p·x ≤ p·ω for all agents  
- **Per-round value feasibility**: For each agent in the market, value of same-round sells from personal stock at p ≥ value of buys at p
- **Personal inventory constraints**: Per-good sells ≤ personal inventory at market-entry snapshot
- **Zero-wealth exclusion**: Agents with wealth ≤ FEASIBILITY_TOL excluded from LTE pricing (prevents singular Jacobians, α-only demand with zero wealth)
- **Snapshot integrity**: `personal_at_entry` must equal actual personal inventory when agent enters marketplace (prevents mid-round financing)
- **Wealth consistency**: `wealth_at_pricing` must equal `p · total_endowment` at price computation time for all marketplace participants
- **Market status validation**: `in_market_bool` must match actual geometric position within marketplace boundaries
- **Home/personal conservation**: Transfers between ω^home and ω^personal when at home must conserve ω^total exactly (within FEASIBILITY_TOL)
- **Walras' Law**: ∑ᵢ pⱼ·zᵢⱼ(p) = 0 for any price vector
- **Normalization**: p₁ ≡ 1 (numéraire constraint)

### Performance Implementation Guidelines
- **Agent data structures**: Use numpy arrays for endowments, vectorized operations for excess demand computation
- **Spatial indexing**: Hash table for O(1) agent location lookup, spatial partitioning for movement pathfinding
- **Equilibrium solving**: Cache Jacobian computations for Cobb-Douglas utilities, reuse previous prices as warm start
- **Memory efficiency**: Preallocate arrays for agent states, reuse workspace arrays across rounds
- **Bottleneck profiling**: JIT-compile equilibrium solver and excess demand functions with numba for 10x+ speedup

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **Core**: numpy, scipy (optimization and numerical methods)
- **Visualization**: pygame (real-time agent movement display)
- **Performance**: numba (optional JIT compilation for bottlenecks)
- **Development**: pytest, black, mypy, flake8
- **Analysis**: pandas, matplotlib (data analysis and plotting)

### Key Design Principles
- **Theoretical foundation**: Start with rigorous Walrasian equilibrium, then add realistic frictions
- **Vectorized operations**: All agent properties and calculations use numpy arrays for 100+ agent performance
- **Spatial optimization**: A* pathfinding with caching for efficient movement
- **Economic validation**: Automated testing of all economic invariants and theoretical properties
- **Modular progression**: Clean separation between economic theory phases
- **Reproducibility**: All experiments configurable via YAML with fixed random seeds

### Development Setup
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run validation tests
pytest tests/validation/

# Run specific scenario  
python scripts/run_simulation.py --config config/edgeworth.yaml --seed 42

# Generate figures from logs
make figures
```

## Future Extensions

### Phase 3: Local Price Formation
- **Bilateral bargaining**: Nash bargaining solution for co-located agents outside marketplace
- **Market mechanisms**: Continuous double auction with order books in marketplace
- **Spatial price variation**: Prices differ across locations, arbitrage opportunities drive movement
- **Market microstructure**: Bid-ask spreads, market makers, liquidity provision

### Phase 4: Advanced Economics  
- **Production**: Firms, technology, factor markets with spatial location decisions
- **Money and credit**: Monetary economics, banking, financial markets
- **Institutions**: Contracts, property rights, governance structures
- **Behavioral economics**: Bounded rationality, learning, social preferences
- **Policy analysis**: Framework for testing economic hypotheses and interventions

### Testing That Teaches Economics

    else:
        # Skip optimality assertion for other regimes
        pytest.skip(f"A* optimality not guaranteed under regime: {regime}")
```

### Research Applications
- **Optimal market design**: How should market size and location affect welfare?
- **Transportation economics**: Model shipping costs, infrastructure investment
- **Urban economics**: Spatial equilibrium with heterogeneous locations
- **Development economics**: Market access and rural-urban linkages
- **Industrial organization**: Firm location and competition with spatial differentiation

- [ ] Know primary convergence test (rest-goods norm ||Z(p)_{2:n}||_∞ < 1e-8)
- [ ] Grasp local-participants pricing principle (POST-MOVE marketplace agents only)
- [ ] Review constrained clearing algorithm contract in API section
- [ ] Set up validation scenario V1 (Edgeworth 2×2) for testing

- [ ] Review edge cases (empty marketplace, single participant, single good)

## Repository Scaffolding

**Recommended folder structure for first PRs:**
- `src/core/` (agents, state, utils)
- `src/econ/` (solver, clearing)
- `src/spatial/` (grid, movement) 
- `scripts/run_simulation.py`, `scripts/validate_scenario.py`
- `tests/validation/` (V1–V8), `tests/unit/` (solver, clearing)
- `config/edgeworth.yaml`, `config/zero_movement_cost.yaml`

**Essential data types for logging:**
```python
@dataclass
class Trade:
    agent_id: int
    good_id: int
    quantity: float  # + = buy, - = sell
    price: float
    round: int

@dataclass  
class SimulationState:
    round: int
    prices: Optional[np.ndarray]  # None if no pricing this round
    trades: List[Trade]
    agent_positions: Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]]
    marketplace_participants: Set[int]
```

Final statistics on initial vs ending inventory, initial vs ending utility, and items sold/purchased for each agent are printed to the console, with real-time visualization via pygame.
