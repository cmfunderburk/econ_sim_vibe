# Development Summary: Replay Scrub, Spatial Fidelity (Positions), Round Summary Export

Date: 2025-09-21
Schema Version: 1.1.0

## Scope Completed
- Replay random access backend: Added round index map, `frame_at(round)`, and `prev_frame()` to `LogReplayStream` for O(1) round retrieval and backward navigation.
- Spatial fidelity (phase 1): Reconstructed per-agent positions and marketplace membership in replay frames (distance + geometry deferred).
- Round summary export: Implemented aggregated CSV (`<run>_round_summary.csv`) with per-round prices, participation counts, executed aggregate vectors, unmet aggregate vectors, and average fill rates.
- Integrity: Existing minimal run-level digest retained (no per-frame hash yet) and metadata sidecar now references summary CSV file.
- Tests: Added coverage for scrub navigation, spatial agent reconstruction, and summary export.

## Files Added / Modified
- `src/logging/run_logger.py`: Added round summary CSV generation and metadata augmentation.
- `src/visualization/playback.py`: (earlier step) Added random access + spatial reconstruction helpers.
- Tests:
  - `tests/unit/test_log_replay_scrub_and_spatial.py`
  - `tests/unit/test_round_summary_export.py`
- Roadmap updated (`docs/ROADMAP.md`) with new status & reordered backlog.
- Summary file (this document) added under `copilot_summaries/`.

## Key Design Decisions
1. CSV chosen for round summary (lightweight, quick diffing) while preserving full-fidelity JSONL/Parquet raw log.
2. Deferred per-round frame hashing until geometry + distance fields finalized to avoid hash churn.
3. Spatial reconstruction limited to stored positions; distances set to placeholder (0 if in market, else None) pending geometry ingest.
4. Aggregation strategy: Serialize vector metrics as semicolon-separated strings to keep CSV narrow and human diffable.

## Invariants Preserved
- Logging schema remains backward compatible (additive only).
- No changes to economic solver or clearing invariants.
- Replay code is read-only and does not mutate underlying log records.

## Test Coverage Added
- Scrub navigation path (forward, backward, random access) correctness.
- Spatial agent frame presence with correct positions & marketplace flags.
- Existence and basic schema of round summary CSV.

## Known Limitations / Next Steps
- Missing GUI key bindings for backward seek & direct round jump.
- No distance-to-market or marketplace geometry in replay frames yet.
- No per-round hash or extended frame signature integrity check.
- Summary CSV lacks solver residuals, travel cost totals, and distance metrics (await geometry instrumentation).
- Video export & live chart overlays still pending (prioritized after geometry fidelity).

## Recommended Immediate Next Steps
1. Geometry Sidecar: Emit marketplace bounds + grid dims in metadata or new sidecar for accurate distance reconstruction.
2. Distance Reconstruction: Populate `distance_to_market` in replay frames; add to summary CSV.
3. GUI Controls: Map LEFT/RIGHT (or dedicated keys) to `prev_frame` / `next_frame`, and add quick numeric seek input.
4. Optional Frame Hashing: Introduce stable field subset hashing once geometry stabilized; store in integrity sidecar.
5. Parquet Summary (Optional): Provide `--export-summary-parquet` flag for higher precision analytics pipelines.

## Deferred Items (Rationale)
- A* Pathfinding: Postpone to avoid scope creep until pedagogical replay baseline fully featured.
- TOTAL_WEALTH financing visualization: Await activation of financing mode variant.
- Per-round cryptographic signatures: Prevent repeated hash invalidation during active schema enrichment.
