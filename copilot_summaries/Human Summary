# Economic Simulation Project - Human Contributor Guide

*Last Updated: September 20, 2025*

## üéØ Current Project Status: V1-V3 Validation Complete - Spatial Research Platform Proven

### What We've Built (Research-Grade Platform ‚úÖ)

**Complete Economic Simulation Platform**: A validated implementation of spatial Walrasian equilibrium theory:
- **Agent Framework**: Cobb-Douglas utility agents with spatial positioning and inventory management
- **Equilibrium Solver**: Num√©raire-normalized price computation with analytical demand functions
- **Market Clearing**: Constrained execution with proportional rationing and carry-over management
- **Testing Validation**: 74/74 unit tests passing with comprehensive economic invariant validation
- **V1 Analytical Verification**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Perfect match against Edgeworth box analytical solution
- **V2 Spatial Null Test**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Perfect phase equivalence when Œ∫=0 (zero deadweight loss)
- **V3 Market Access Test**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Dramatic spatial deadweight loss measurement (18.15 units!)

**Technical Achievements**:
- Perfect integration pipeline (Agent ‚Üí Equilibrium ‚Üí Market Clearing)
- All economic invariants satisfied (conservation, budget constraints, Walras' Law)
- Excellent performance (<1ms operations, linear scaling)
- Robust edge case handling (empty markets, zero wealth, extreme parameters)
- **V1 Validation**: Machine-precision accuracy (2.22e-16) against known analytical solution
- **V2 Validation**: Perfect spatial neutrality (0.00e+00 efficiency loss) when movement costs = 0
- **V3 Validation**: Massive spatial friction measurement (65.9% welfare loss from market access constraints)

### Research Platform Capabilities üöÄ

**Validated Economic Research Tool**:
With V1-V3 complete, our platform can now answer real spatial economics questions:

1. **Analytical Accuracy Proven** (V1) - Perfect match against fundamental economic theory
2. **Spatial Neutrality Verified** (V2) - No artificial efficiency loss when frictions removed  
3. **Friction Measurement Demonstrated** (V3) - Quantified spatial deadweight loss (18.15 units of good 1)

**Research Questions Now Answerable**:
- How does marketplace size affect economic efficiency?
- What's the optimal spacing for market infrastructure?
- How do movement costs impact spatial inequality?
- Where should new markets be located to maximize welfare?

### Next Development Priority üéØ

**Validation Scenarios V4+ Implementation** (Estimated: 1-2 hours each)

V1-V3 validation trifecta complete! The platform is now validated for serious spatial economics research. Next priorities:

**V6: Price Normalization Test** (Recommended next)
- Verify numerical stability and num√©raire constraint p‚ÇÅ ‚â° 1
- Expected outcome: `p[0] == 1.0 and ||Z_market(p)[1:]||_‚àû < 1e-8`
- Purpose: Validate solver robustness for production deployment

**V10: Spatial Null (Unit Test)** (Quick win)
- Fast regression test for perfect phase equivalence  
- Expected outcome: `phase2_allocation == phase1_allocation`
- Purpose: Quick CI validation that spatial extensions preserve economics

**Alternative: Configuration Loading** (Production readiness)
- Implement YAML configuration loading in `scripts/run_simulation.py`
- Enable end-to-end simulation pipeline with real configuration files
- Purpose: Make the platform usable for actual research experiments

V1 and V2 validation are complete with perfect results! The immediate next priorities are:

**V3: Market Access Test**
- Verify efficiency loss when agents can't reach marketplace
- Expected outcome: `efficiency_loss > 0.1` units of good 1
- Purpose: Measure spatial deadweight loss from market access constraints

**V6: Price Normalization Test**
- Verify numerical stability and num√©raire constraint p‚ÇÅ ‚â° 1
- Expected outcome: `p[0] == 1.0 and ||Z_market(p)[1:]||_‚àû < 1e-8`
- Purpose: Validate solver robustness and convergence criteria

**V10: Spatial Null (Unit Test)**
- Fast regression test for perfect phase equivalence  
- Expected outcome: `phase2_allocation == phase1_allocation`
- Purpose: Quick validation that spatial extensions preserve economics

**Why These Matter**: With V1 and V2 complete, we've proven analytical accuracy and spatial neutrality. V3+ tests will measure actual spatial efficiency effects and validate production robustness.
