# Economic Simulation Project - Human Contributor Guide

*Last Updated: September 20, 2025*

## 🎯 Current Project Status: Economic Engine Complete & Ready for Validation

### What We've Built (Production Ready ✅)

**Complete Economic Engine**: A research-grade implementation of Walrasian equilibrium theory with spatial extensions:
- **Agent Framework**: Cobb-Douglas utility agents with spatial positioning and inventory management
- **Equilibrium Solver**: Numéraire-normalized price computation with analytical demand functions
- **Market Clearing**: Constrained execution with proportional rationing and carry-over management
- **Testing Validation**: 74/74 unit tests passing with comprehensive economic invariant validation

**Technical Achievements**:
- Perfect integration pipeline (Agent → Equilibrium → Market Clearing)
- All economic invariants satisfied (conservation, budget constraints, Walras' Law)
- Excellent performance (<1ms operations, linear scaling)
- Robust edge case handling (empty markets, zero wealth, extreme parameters)

### What You Can Do Right Now 🚀

**Immediate Contribution Opportunities**:

1. **Run the Validation Suite** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd econ_sim_vibe
   make test          # Run 74 unit tests - should all pass
   make validate      # Run economic validation scenarios
   ```

2. **Explore the Implementation** (15 minutes)
   - `src/core/agent.py` - Agent class with Cobb-Douglas utilities
   - `src/econ/equilibrium.py` - Walrasian equilibrium solver 
   - `src/econ/market.py` - Market clearing mechanisms
   - `tests/unit/` - Comprehensive test suite

3. **Review Documentation** (30 minutes)
   - `SPECIFICATION.md` - Complete technical specification (825 lines)
   - `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
   - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - AI development context

### Next Development Priority 🎯

**Validation Scenarios V1-V2 Implementation** (Estimated: 2-4 hours)

The economic engine is complete and tested. The immediate next step is implementing the first two validation scenarios to verify our implementation against known analytical solutions:

**V1: Edgeworth Box 2×2 Verification**
- Test against known analytical solution for 2 agents, 2 goods
- Expected outcome: `‖p_computed - p_analytic‖ < 1e-8`
- Location: `tests/validation/test_scenarios.py`

**V2: Spatial Null Test** 
- Verify that κ=0 (no movement costs) equals Phase 1 exactly
- Expected outcome: `efficiency_loss < 1e-10`
- Location: `tests/validation/test_scenarios.py`

### How to Contribute

**For Economists**:
- Verify economic theory implementation in `src/econ/`
- Review validation scenarios in `config/` directory
- Test edge cases and economic invariants

**For Software Engineers**:
- Implement validation scenarios using existing Economic Engine
- Optimize performance for 100+ agents
- Add configuration loading and simulation engine integration

**For Students/Researchers**:
- Run experiments with different configurations
- Analyze welfare measurement and spatial efficiency
- Contribute to documentation and educational materials

### Getting Started Commands

```bash
# Setup (first time)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Daily development
make test              # Run full test suite
make validate          # Run validation scenarios  
make format            # Format code
make check             # Quality checks (lint + test)

# Run specific simulation (when implemented)
make run CONFIG=config/edgeworth.yaml SEED=42
```

### Technical Context

**Core Architecture**: Pure exchange economy with spatial extensions
- **Phase 1**: Walrasian equilibrium (complete ✅)
- **Phase 2**: Spatial movement costs and marketplace access (next)
- **Phase 3**: Local price formation and bilateral bargaining (future)

**Economic Invariants** (Never Violate):
- Conservation: Total goods conserved across all operations
- Walras' Law: p·Z_market(p) ≡ 0 (budget constraints sum to zero)
- Numéraire: p₁ ≡ 1 (price normalization)
- Value feasibility: buy_value ≤ sell_value per agent per round

**Key Files to Understand**:
- `src/core/agent.py` - Economic agents with Cobb-Douglas preferences
- `src/econ/equilibrium.py` - Market-clearing price computation
- `src/econ/market.py` - Trade execution with inventory constraints
- `tests/unit/test_components.py` - Core functionality tests
