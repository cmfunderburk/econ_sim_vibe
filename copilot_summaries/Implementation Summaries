economic validation framework for the simulation. All scenarios test critical economic 
properties and edge cases required for production deployment.

IMPLEMENTED VALIDATION SCENARIOS:

V4 Throughput Cap - Market capacity constraints and proportional rationing
✅ 3 agents with capacity limits [0.5, 0.5] properly enforced
✅ Volume reduction: market demand 2.38 units → capacity limited to 0.5 units
✅ Proportional rationing mechanism: 3.76 units unmet demand/supply generated
✅ Economic invariants preserved: conservation, value feasibility, market balance

V5 Spatial Dominance - Phase 2 efficiency ≤ Phase 1 efficiency validation  
✅ 5 diverse agents with movement cost scenarios (κ=0, 0.1, 1.0, ∞)
✅ Welfare dominance confirmed: all Phase 2 scenarios ≤ Phase 1 frictionless optimum
✅ Economic insight: autarky (κ=∞) = 5.25 welfare > large costs (κ=1.0) = 3.73 welfare
✅ Spatial friction modeling: efficiency losses of 0.32, 3.18, 1.65 units respectively

V7 Empty Marketplace - Edge case handling for robust system behavior
✅ Empty marketplace: prices=None, trades=[] gracefully handled  
✅ Single participant: insufficient for equilibrium detection

================================================================================

## 🎯 MILESTONE: Second Validation Scenario Successfully Implemented!

Successfully implemented and validated the V2 Spatial Null Test, proving that our spatial extensions preserve perfect economic equivalence when movement costs κ=0. This critical test validates that Phase 2 spatial simulations don't break baseline economics.

### ✅ **V2 Spatial Null Test Results Summary**

**Test Implementation**: `tests/validation/test_scenarios.py::test_v2_spatial_null`

**Perfect Phase Equivalence Achieved**:
- ✅ Price difference: 0.00e+00 < 1e-10 (identical prices between phases)
- ✅ Clearing efficiency difference: 0.00e+00 < 1e-10 (identical market performance)  
- ✅ Welfare loss: 0.00e+00 < 1e-10 (zero deadweight loss as expected)
- ✅ Total welfare difference: 0.00e+00 (perfect welfare preservation)

**Test Configuration**:
- 10 agents with 3 goods each, random Cobb-Douglas preferences
- Movement cost κ = 0.0 (spatial friction disabled)
- All agents positioned at marketplace center (5,5) 
- Deterministic seed (42) for reproducible results

**Economic Verification**:
- Phase 1: Pure Walrasian equilibrium computation
- Phase 2: Spatial simulation with all agents at marketplace

TITLE: V3 Market Access Test - Spatial Deadweight Loss Measurement Achieved
================================================================================

## 🎯 MILESTONE: First Spatial Friction Validation Complete!

Successfully implemented and validated the V3 Market Access Test, demonstrating that our spatial model captures dramatic deadweight loss from market access restrictions. This is the first validation to measure actual spatial efficiency effects rather than just validating neutrality.

### ✅ **V3 Market Access Results Summary**

**Test Implementation**: `tests/validation/test_scenarios.py::test_v3_market_access`

**Dramatic Spatial Deadweight Loss Measured**:
- ✅ Efficiency loss: 18.15 > 0.1 units of good 1 (far exceeds expected threshold)
- ✅ Market access restriction: Only 1/20 agents reached marketplace initially
- ✅ Spatial dominance confirmed: Positive efficiency loss demonstrates spatial frictions work
- ✅ Travel cost impact: 19/20 agents faced travel costs averaging 2.947 units

**Test Configuration Validated**:
- 20 agents with 3 goods, scattered across 15×15 grid
- Small 2×2 marketplace in center (restricts access)
- Movement cost κ = 0.5 units per grid step
- Deterministic seed (42) for reproducible results

**Economic Mechanism Verification**:
- **Baseline welfare**: 27.56 (frictionless Walrasian equilibrium)
- **Spatial welfare**: 9.41 (with travel costs and access restrictions)
- **Efficiency loss**: 18.15 units of good 1 (65.9% welfare loss!)
- **Travel cost formula**: w_i = max(0, p·ω_i - κ·d_i) working correctly

**Spatial Economics Validated**:
- Agents far from marketplace face budget constraints from travel costs
- Some agents effectively priced out of market participation
- Market access restrictions create locational disadvantage
- Deadweight loss scales appropriately with distance and movement costs

**Implementation Technical Details**:
- Proper marketplace boundary detection and agent filtering
- Manhattan distance calculation for travel cost computation
- Budget-constrained demand with travel cost deductions
