Economics module: Walrasian solver and market clearing algorithms.

This module implements the core economic logic:
- Walrasian equilibrium solver with Cobb-Douglas optimizations
- Constrained market clearing with proportional rationing
- Local Theoretical Equilibrium (LTE) pricing
- Budget constraint validation and feasibility checks
