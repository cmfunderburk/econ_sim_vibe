"""Enhanced economic invariant tests.

Focus Areas:
1. Solver fallback improvement guarantee (tatonnement must not worsen residual)
2. Randomized conservation fuzz test over many small economies
3. Per-agent barter (value feasibility) invariant after constrained clearing
4. Movement monotonicity: Manhattan distance to marketplace should weakly decrease under greedy policy

Assumptions:
- Greedy movement policy implemented (not A*). We only assert non-increasing Manhattan distance.
- Prices solved using total endowments; execution constrained by personal inventory.
