    V1: Edgeworth Box 2×2 Analytical Verification

    Tests our Economic Engine against the known analytical solution for the classic
    2-agent, 2-good Edgeworth box economy.

    Setup:
    - Agent 1: preferences α₁ = [0.6, 0.4], endowment ω₁ = [1, 0]
    - Agent 2: preferences α₂ = [0.3, 0.7], endowment ω₂ = [0, 1]

    Analytical Solution:
    For Cobb-Douglas agents, the equilibrium price ratio is determined by:
    p₂/p₁ = (α₁₂/α₁₁) * (ω₁₁/ω₁₂) * (α₂₁/α₂₂) * (ω₂₂/ω₂₁)

    With our parameters:
    p₂/p₁ = (0.4/0.6) * (1/0) → Need to solve the full system

    Using market clearing conditions and Cobb-Douglas demands:
    x₁₁ = α₁₁ * (p₁*ω₁₁ + p₂*ω₁₂) / p₁ = 0.6 * p₁ / p₁ = 0.6
    x₁₂ = α₁₂ * (p₁*ω₁₁ + p₂*ω₁₂) / p₂ = 0.4 * p₁ / p₂
    x₂₁ = α₂₁ * (p₁*ω₂₁ + p₂*ω₂₂) / p₁ = 0.3 * p₂ / p₁
    x₂₂ = α₂₂ * (p₁*ω₂₁ + p₂*ω₂₂) / p₂ = 0.7 * p₂ / p₂ = 0.7

    Market clearing: x₁₁ + x₂₁ = 1, x₁₂ + x₂₂ = 1
    0.6 + 0.3 * p₂/p₁ = 1  →  p₂/p₁ = 4/3
    0.4 * p₁/p₂ + 0.7 = 1   →  p₁/p₂ = 3/4  →  p₂/p₁ = 4/3 ✓

    Therefore: p* = [1, 4/3] with numéraire p₁ ≡ 1
